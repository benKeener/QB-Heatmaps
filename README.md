# QB-Heatmaps
Using the nflfastR package to create heatmaps for quarterbacks over the 2019 season

This code uses data from nflscrapR to create heatmaps based on the passing tendencies of quarterbacks for the 2019-2020 NFL season

Players with a deeper red on their heatmaps will target that specific area more often.
